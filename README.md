# chorusAvery
An  open-source project dedicated to listening — truly listening — to the wild.   Named for the wetlands and woodlands of Carlos Avery, Minnesota, this project uses machine learning and gentle human review to explore birdsong, identify species, and preserve the forgotten voices that slip through automated filters.
