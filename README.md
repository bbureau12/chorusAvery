# Chorus Avery

**Chorus Avery** is an open-source project dedicated to listening â€” truly listening â€” to the wild.  
Named for the wetlands and woodlands of Carlos Avery, Minnesota, this project uses machine learning and gentle human review to explore birdsong, identify species, and preserve the forgotten voices that slip through automated filters.

Built on top of tools like BirdNET, Librosa, and the Merlin app, **Chorus Avery** creates a hybrid approach:
- Use pretrained models to identify common bird calls
- Flag uncertain or unknown sounds for deeper exploration
- Generate a growing dataset of confirmed and mystery bird calls
- Offer spectrograms, audio snippets, and potential for custom classification

This project is both a scientific tool and a meditation â€” a way of honoring the living world one chirp at a time.

### Goals
- Detect birdsong from long-form nature recordings
- Identify known species using pretrained models
- Extract and explore unknown or unclassified calls
- Build a high-quality dataset for conservation, curiosity, or training

### Why?
Many calls go unnoticed by automated tools.  
**Chorus Avery** listens again â€” for the rare, the subtle, the beautiful.
